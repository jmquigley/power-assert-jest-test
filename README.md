# power-assert-jest-test

Test repo showing [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Power Assert](https://github.com/power-assert-js/power-assert) with a simple test.  The test shows an issue with power assert printing its output twice.

Use `npm run all` to retrieve the dependencies and run the jest test.  This assumes you have a working node environment with npm.  The test code is in `test.js`.  Jest will automatically call babel to transform, instrument, and run the test.
